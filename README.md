This project aims to develop a computer vision-based system for tracking colored balls and detecting their movement across predefined quadrants within a video frame. By leveraging color detection and contour analysis, the system identifies balls of specified colors and logs events when these balls enter or exit designated quadrants. This project demonstrates the application of OpenCV for real-time object tracking and event logging.
